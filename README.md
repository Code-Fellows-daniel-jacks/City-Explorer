# City-Explorer

**Author**: Daniel Jackson
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview
This application will allow you to enter a city name, and return relevant information (and images) pertaining to the specified city. This uses the Location IQ API to get data and pull it in based on the user's input. 

## Getting Started
You'll need React, React-Bootstrap (if you'd like to us the pre-built components), and GitHub/Netlify to deploy the project.

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->

## Change Log
<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an example:

01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the location resource. -->
